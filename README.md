A bundle of extensions to optimize your Visual Studio Code environment while working on PowerShell projects.

This pack of extensions contains the tools that I most often rely on while working on PowerShell modules and scripts. My workflow involves managing all code on GitHub. It usually also involves creating documentation in Markdown. As a result, I consider GitHub and Markdown-related extensions to be key components of this pack.
However, if you prefer, you can still selectively install only the extensions that you want to use.

**Note:** All credit and much gratitude goes out to the awesome community members and organizations that have freely made these extensions available. I have not created any of them myself.
